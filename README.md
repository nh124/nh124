# :coffee: Hi, I am Nur Haque

**`Tech Tamer Senpi (Developer/Designer/Collaborator)`**

I'm a full-stack developer and an instructor contributing to open-source projects. The projects I create are designed to solve a small-scale problem that I face every day or help a friend achieve a dream project. All projects I create get showcased in my portfolio with a video breaking down on how this project came to be. The planning for each project starts with a problem, the next planning, designing, and then implementing. With the feedback of many of my peers, and potential users the projects grow into something worth using. I strive to help many individuals with whatever they are working on whether that's designing a webpage, building the next hit game, or just something weebish. :fish_cake:
